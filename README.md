### For the Acerola Jam 0
# Poly Zero (PT)
## A playable teaser for my series Poly
- Made with Godot

You play as Poly, a little kid robot who is a nomad and travels the world, seeking as many new experiences as possible. Poly refers to this as him "aberrating" since he will always try to specifically take the off roads.

You take control of Poly just after an earthquake hit the peaceful, snowy area he was aberrating thorough.
Poly fell into a crevase and now has to make his way out

Things of note:
- This is more of a playable teaser/tech demo than a game, there's not much actual gameplay except the swinging stuff and some simple "combat"
- Sorry no instructions in game, they are here instead
- There is NO SOUND OR MUSIC since I'm NOT A SOUND OR MUSIC GUY
- There is a door in the playground to leave when you are ready

### CONTROLS
- WASD movement
- Your cursor will snap to surfaces you can grab and also the lone enemy in the playground
- When your cursor in on a grabbable piece of wall then click with either the left or right mouse to anchor your arm there
- Poly then can swing around, press space to detach your arm (This will detach both arms if they are both anchored)
- Movement is based off of Gold Source (since i used the GoldGdt controller as a base) so keep that in mind, holding movement keys won't make you swing faster, it just caps your speed

Made Using:
- Junk Box - Me
- Godot Jolt - mihe
